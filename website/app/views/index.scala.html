        <h2>Give help, and get help, locally</h2>

        <p>The Help Network revolves around your local community.</p>

        <p>You offer your time, and maybe more than that, to someone living in your city, or for a project happening
            nearby.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>No money involved</h2>

        <p>We don't believe in the current financial system, and want to disrupt it.</p>

        <p>Unless you provide something costly for someone or for a project, try your best to keep money out of it.</p>

        <p>Prefer alternatives such as gifting, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_currency" target="_blank">alternative
            currency</a>, or simply do it for free if you can!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>It's about what you <em>do</em></h2>

        <p>The most important part of your user profile is the references of how you have been participating.</p>

        <p>Those references shouldn't be overlooked, as they are central to a healthy network where helpers are
            rewarded, and where abuse is kept at bay.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>We are independant</h2>

        <p>No VC funding. No advertising.</p>

        <p>And we respect your data: it won't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29" target="_blank">be
            shared</a>.</p>
